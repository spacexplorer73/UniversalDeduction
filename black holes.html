<h1>Black Holes</h1><br>
<B>DESCRIPTION:-</B><br><br>
<strong>Black Holes are naturally occuring phenomenon in the curavture of space-time. They can also be called as one of the <u>solutions of Einstein's Field Equations</u>.In a gross term, Black Holes are a large mass concentrated at a much small volume.</strong><br><br>

<B>SOME DEFINITIONS:-</B>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Event Horizon</li>
<strong>The surface of black hole beyond which even light cannot escape.</strong><br>
<li>Accretion Disk</li>
<strong>A structure formed by diffused material in motion around a massive central body. The central body most oftenly is a star.</strong><br>
<li>Relativistic Jets</li>
<strong>Powerful jets of radiation and particles, travelling close to the speed of light. Mostly observed in Super Massive Black Holes.</strong><br>
<li>Singularity</li>
<strong>A point which contains a huge mass in an infinitely small space, where density and gravity become infinite and space-time curves infinitely. The Laws of Physics as we know them cease to exist here.</strong><br>
